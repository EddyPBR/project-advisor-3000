## :mortar_board: The Idea

I am attending several classes and taking several courses in the world of Node, React and ReactNative and I found a course by the guys at [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) these guys are incredible they have several free courses and they teach very well!

One of these courses is the development of an API with express, mongo and Node. So the idea of ​​this project is to replicate what these guys did and add an interface with React and automated tests.

## :wrench: Create Your Secret

To log in to the api, it is necessary to create a unique password, where you will create it 
yourself. It's very simple just follow these steps:

- Acess the following path: <br />
  `./backend/src/config/`

- Create the following file <br />
  `auth.json`

- Now we have to create an encrypted secret in md5. For this access this
[Page](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/ "Page"). <br />

- Now inside the auth.json file write the following: <br />
  `{ "secret": "theSecretYouCreatedHere" }`
